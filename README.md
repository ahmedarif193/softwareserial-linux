# softwareserial-linux


This project has been adapted from Adrianomarto's original work on soft UART for the Raspberry Pi, available at https://github.com/adrianomarto/soft_uart. 

A huge acknowledgment to him for his exceptional contribution. This version extends his work into a more generalized module, It uses device tree to create multiple instances of softserial ports.
